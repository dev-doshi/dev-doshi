**Hello!** 👋

I'm a 16-year-old person who loves coding. I live in Germany 🇩🇪 and I'm really into Python and Swift/SwiftUI.

- ✨ I'm really excited about turning lines of code into cool solutions and making things that are easy for people to use.
- 🎯 My main goal is to bring ideas to life through programming. I'm always learning and trying out new technologies.
- 🧠 I like working with others and being part of team projects. I use my skills to create software that works well and looks nice.
- 💡 I believe in sharing and helping others in the coding community. I like contributing to open-source projects.
- 🌱 I'm always learning new things on my own and keeping up with what's happening in the industry.
- 💻 When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing chess. 

🚀 Let's connect and work together to create something really amazing!
